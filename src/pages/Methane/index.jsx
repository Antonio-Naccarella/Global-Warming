        <p>
          Methane is a flammable gas formed by geological and biological
          processes. Some of the natural ones are leaks from natural gas systems
          and wetlands. 50-65% of total global methane emissions come from human
          activities. These include livestock, agriculture, oil and gas systems,
          waste from homes and businesses, landfills, and so on. Methane is a
          gas with a global warming potential several times stronger than of
          CO2. For more than 650,000 years, methane concentration in the
          atmosphere was between 350 â€“ 800 ppb. From the beginning of the
          industrial revolution, human activities have increased this amount by
          around 150%.
